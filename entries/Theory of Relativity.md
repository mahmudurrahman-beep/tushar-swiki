## Special Relativity (1905)
- Applies to physics **without gravity**.  
- Key principles:
  - Laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.  
  - Speed of light is constant for all observers.  
- Consequences:
  - **Time dilation**: moving clocks run slower.  
  - **Length contraction**: moving objects shrink along direction of motion.  
  - **Relativity of simultaneity**: events may occur at different times depending on the observer.  
- Famous equation:  
  \[
  E = mc^2
  \]  
  Energy and mass are interchangeable.

## General Relativity (1915)
- Extends relativity to include **gravity**.  
- Gravity is not a force but the **curvature of spacetime** caused by mass and energy.  
- Predictions:
  - **Gravitational time dilation** (clocks run slower near massive bodies).  
  - **Light bending** around stars (gravitational lensing).  
  - **Black holes** as regions of extreme spacetime curvature.  
  - **Gravitational waves**, ripples in spacetime (detected in 2015).  

## Importance
- Superseded Newtonian mechanics for high speeds and strong gravity.  
- Foundation for **modern cosmology** (Big Bang, expanding universe).  
- Essential for technologies like **GPS**, which must account for relativistic effects.  

## Legacy
Einstein’s relativity transformed our understanding of **space, time, energy, and gravity**, shaping 20th‑century physics and beyond.
