## Definition
The **oceans of the world** are vast bodies of salt water that cover about **71% of Earth’s surface** and contain about **97% of Earth’s water**. They are critical to climate regulation, biodiversity, and human civilization.

## The Five Major Oceans

1. **Pacific Ocean**
   - Largest and deepest ocean.  
   - Covers more than 63 million square miles.  
   - Contains the **Mariana Trench**, the deepest point on Earth.  
   - Borders Asia, Australia, and the Americas.  

2. **Atlantic Ocean**
   - Second largest ocean.  
   - Covers about 41 million square miles.  
   - Known for the **Mid‑Atlantic Ridge**, a major underwater mountain range.  
   - Borders Europe, Africa, and the Americas.  

3. **Indian Ocean**
   - Third largest ocean.  
   - Covers about 27 million square miles.  
   - Warmest ocean, heavily used for trade routes.  
   - Borders Africa, Asia, and Australia.  

4. **Southern Ocean**
   - Encircles Antarctica.  
   - Recognized officially in 2000 by the International Hydrographic Organization.  
   - Known for strong currents (Antarctic Circumpolar Current).  
   - Rich in marine life, including krill and whales.  

5. **Arctic Ocean**
   - Smallest and shallowest ocean.  
   - Covers about 5.4 million square miles.  
   - Located around the North Pole.  
   - Covered partly by sea ice year‑round.  

## Importance
- **Climate Regulation** – Oceans absorb heat and carbon dioxide, influencing global weather.  
- **Biodiversity** – Home to millions of species, from plankton to whales.  
- **Economy** – Provide trade routes, fisheries, and energy resources.  
- **Human Civilization** – Oceans have shaped exploration, culture, and history.  

## Fun Facts
- The Pacific Ocean is larger than all landmasses combined.  
- The Atlantic Ocean is growing wider due to seafloor spreading.  
- The Indian Ocean has monsoon‑driven currents.  
- The Southern Ocean is the youngest named ocean.  
- The Arctic Ocean is shrinking due to climate change.
