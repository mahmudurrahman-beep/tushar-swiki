The **Balfour Declaration** was a pivotal statement in Middle Eastern and world history. It was issued in the form of a letter from **Arthur James Balfour**, the British Foreign Secretary, to **Lord Walter Rothschild**, a leader of the British Jewish community.

## Background

- Date: **November 2, 1917**  
- Context: World War I and British interests in the Middle East.  
- Britain sought support from Jewish communities worldwide, particularly in the United States and Russia.  
- Zionist leaders lobbied for recognition of Jewish aspirations for a homeland in Palestine.  

## Text (Summary)

His Majesty’s Government viewed with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and promised to use their best endeavors to facilitate this.  
It also stated that nothing should prejudice the civil and religious rights of non‑Jewish communities in Palestine, nor the rights of Jews in other countries.  

## Key Figures

## Legacy
