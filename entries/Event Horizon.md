## Definition
An **event horizon** is the boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing—not even light—can escape. It represents the point at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light.

## Scientific Background
- Rooted in **Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (1915)**.  
- A black hole forms when a massive star collapses under gravity.  
- The event horizon marks the limit of observable information; anything crossing it is lost to outside observers.  

## Properties
- **Schwarzschild Radius** – The radius of the event horizon for a non‑rotating black hole.  
- **No Escape** – Matter and radiation cannot escape once inside.  
- **Time Dilation** – To an outside observer, time appears to slow near the horizon.  
- **Information Paradox** – Raises questions about whether information is destroyed inside black holes.  

## Types of Black Holes
- **Stellar‑Mass Black Holes** – Formed from collapsing stars.  
- **Supermassive Black Holes** – Found at galaxy centers, millions to billions of solar masses.  
- **Rotating (Kerr) Black Holes** – Have event horizons shaped by angular momentum.  

## Importance in Physics
- Central to studies of **gravity, quantum mechanics, and cosmology**.  
- Key to debates about **Hawking radiation** and the fate of information.  
- Provides insights into the limits of space, time, and causality.  

## Cultural References
- Frequently appears in science fiction literature and films.  
- Example: *Event Horizon* (1997), a sci‑fi horror film inspired by black hole concepts.

*The event horizon is both a physical boundary and a philosophical mystery, symbolizing the edge of human knowledge about the universe.*
