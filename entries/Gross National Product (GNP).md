## Definition
**Gross National Product (GNP)** is the total market value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of a country in a given period (usually a year), regardless of whether the production takes place domestically or abroad.  
It differs from **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**, which measures production strictly within a country’s borders.

## Key Features
- **Resident-based measure**: Includes output by citizens and companies abroad.  
- **Excludes foreign production**: Goods and services produced by foreign entities inside the country are not counted.  
- **Time-bound**: Calculated annually or quarterly.  
- **Monetary value**: Expressed in current or constant prices.  

## Formula


\[
GNP = GDP + (Income earned by residents abroad - Income earned by foreigners domestically)
\]



Where:  
- **GDP** = Gross Domestic Product  
- **Income earned by residents abroad** = wages, profits, rents, interest from overseas investments  
- **Income earned by foreigners domestically** = wages, profits, rents, interest earned by non-residents inside the country  

## Types of GNP
- **Nominal GNP**: Measured at current market prices.  
- **Real GNP**: Adjusted for inflation, reflects actual growth.  
- **GNP per capita**: GNP divided by population, showing average income per person.  

## Importance
- **Economic strength**: Indicates the total income of a nation’s residents.  
- **Policy tool**: Helps governments design fiscal and monetary policies.  
- **Global comparison**: Useful for comparing living standards across countries.  
- **Investment indicator**: Shows how much wealth citizens generate, even abroad.  

## Limitations
- Does not measure **income distribution**.  
- Excludes **informal economy** and unpaid work.  
- May overstate wealth if large income comes from abroad but not reinvested domestically.  
- Focuses on production and income, not **quality of life** or sustainability.  

## GNP vs GDP
| Aspect                  | GDP                                      | GNP                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Scope                   | Production within national borders       | Production by residents, anywhere         |
| Includes                | Foreign companies operating domestically | Citizens’ income abroad                   |
| Excludes                | Citizens’ overseas income                | Foreigners’ domestic income               |
| Best for measuring      | Domestic economic activity               | National income of residents              |

## Historical Context
- Concept developed in the **1930s** by economist **Simon Kuznets**.  
- Initially used as the main measure of national income.  
- Since the **1990s**, most countries shifted to **GDP** as the primary measure, though GNP is still reported.  

## Example (Simplified)
- If Bangladesh produces goods worth **$400 billion** domestically (GDP),  
- Citizens earn **$20 billion abroad**,  
- Foreigners earn **$10 billion inside Bangladesh**,  
- Then:  
  

\[
  GNP = 400 + 20 - 10 = 410 \text{ billion USD}
  \]
