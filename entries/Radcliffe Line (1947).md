## Definition
The **Radcliffe Line** was the boundary demarcation line between **India and Pakistan**, drawn in **August 1947** during the Partition of British India. It was named after **Sir Cyril Radcliffe**, the British lawyer who chaired the Boundary Commissions.

## Background
- British India was divided into two independent states: **India** and **Pakistan**.  
- The line was drawn to separate **Punjab** and **Bengal** into Indian and Pakistani territories.  
- Radcliffe had **only five weeks** to complete the boundary, despite having no prior knowledge of Indian conditions.  

## Key Features
- Divided **Punjab** into East Punjab (India) and West Punjab (Pakistan).  
- Divided **Bengal** into West Bengal (India) and East Bengal (later East Pakistan, now Bangladesh).  
- The line was about **3,323 kilometers (2,065 miles)** long.  

## Consequences
- Triggered one of the largest migrations in human history: ~14 million people crossed borders.  
- Widespread communal violence led to the deaths of an estimated **1–2 million people**.  
- Families, villages, and communities were split overnight.  
- Disputes over the line led to conflicts, including wars between India and Pakistan.  

## Legacy
- The Radcliffe Line remains the international border between **India and Pakistan**, and later between **India and Bangladesh**.  
- It symbolizes both the independence of South Asia and the trauma of Partition.  
- Continues to influence geopolitics, security, and cultural identity in the region.
