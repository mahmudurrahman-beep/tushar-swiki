# Japan and Gunboat Diplomacy (Black Ships)

## Background
For over two centuries, under the **Tokugawa shogunate**, Japan followed a policy of **sakoku** (closed country), limiting foreign contact to a few Dutch and Chinese traders at Nagasaki.

## Perry Expedition (1853–1854)
- In **1853**, **Commodore Matthew Perry** of the U.S. Navy sailed into **Tokyo Bay** with heavily armed steam-powered warships, called the **Black Ships (kurofune)** in Japan.  
- Perry demanded Japan open its ports to American trade, using the threat of military force — a classic example of **gunboat diplomacy**.  
- The Japanese, recognizing their military disadvantage, agreed to negotiate.

## Treaties
- **Treaty of Kanagawa (1854):**  
  - Opened two Japanese ports (Shimoda and Hakodate) to U.S. ships.  
  - Established a U.S. consulate in Japan.  
  - Ended Japan’s isolationist policy.  
- Later treaties with other Western powers followed, often unequal and favoring foreign nations.

## Impact
- Marked the **end of Japan’s isolation** and the beginning of its integration into global trade.  
- Sparked internal debate and unrest, eventually contributing to the **Meiji Restoration (1868)**.  
- Japan rapidly modernized its military, industry, and government to resist Western domination.  

## Significance
- Perry’s “big boat diplomacy” is remembered as a turning point in Japanese history.  
- It demonstrated how Western powers used **naval strength** to secure trade and influence.  
- Japan’s response — modernization and industrialization — transformed it into a major world power within decades.
