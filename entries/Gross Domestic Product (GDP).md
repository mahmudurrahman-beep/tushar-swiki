## Definition
**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country’s borders during a specific period (usually a year or quarter). It is the most widely used indicator of a nation’s economic performance.

## Key Features
- **Measure of output**: Captures the size of an economy.  
- **Time-bound**: Calculated quarterly or annually.  
- **Final goods/services only**: Excludes intermediate goods to avoid double counting.  
- **Domestic scope**: Includes production within national borders, regardless of ownership.  

## Methods of Calculation
1. **Production Approach**  
   - Sum of value added at each stage of production.  
2. **Income Approach**  
   - Total incomes earned: wages, rents, interest, profits.  
3. **Expenditure Approach**  
   - Formula:  
     

\[
     GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
     \]

  
     Where:  
     - \(C\) = Consumption  
     - \(I\) = Investment  
     - \(G\) = Government spending  
     - \(X\) = Exports  
     - \(M\) = Imports  

## Types of GDP
- **Nominal GDP**: Measured at current market prices.  
- **Real GDP**: Adjusted for inflation, reflects true growth.  
- **GDP per capita**: GDP divided by population, indicates average economic output per person.  
- **PPP GDP (Purchasing Power Parity)**: Adjusts for cost of living differences across countries.  

## Importance
- **Economic health**: Higher GDP generally signals stronger economies.  
- **Policy decisions**: Governments and central banks use GDP trends to guide fiscal and monetary policy.  
- **Global comparisons**: Used by institutions like the IMF and World Bank to rank economies.  
- **Investment indicator**: Investors track GDP growth to assess market potential.  

## Limitations
- Does not measure **income inequality**.  
- Excludes **non-market activities** (household work, volunteer services).  
- Ignores **environmental costs** and sustainability.  
- Focuses on quantity of output, not quality of life.

| 9    | Italy          | ~2.4                        |
| 10   | Canada         | ~2.3                        |

## Legacy
GDP has become the **global standard for measuring economies**, but modern economists increasingly argue for complementary indicators such as the **Human Development Index (HDI)**, **Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)**, and **Green GDP** to capture well‑being and sustainability.
