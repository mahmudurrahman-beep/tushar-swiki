## Definition
**Taxonomy** is the science of classifying organisms into structured categories based on shared characteristics. It provides a universal system for naming and organizing life forms, making it easier to study biodiversity and evolutionary relationships.

## Origins
- Developed by **Carl Linnaeus** in the 18th century.  
- His system of **binomial nomenclature** (two‑part names: *Genus species*) is still used today.  

## Principles
- Organisms are grouped by **morphology, genetics, and evolutionary history**.  
- Classification is hierarchical, moving from broad to specific categories.  

## Hierarchical Levels
1. **Domain** – Broadest category (e.g., Eukarya, Bacteria, Archaea).  
2. **Kingdom** – Large groups (e.g., Animalia, Plantae, Fungi).  
3. **Phylum** – Major body plans (e.g., Chordata, Arthropoda).  
4. **Class** – Subdivision of phylum (e.g., Mammalia, Insecta).  
5. **Order** – Groups within classes (e.g., Primates, Carnivora).  
6. **Family** – Related genera (e.g., Hominidae, Felidae).  
7. **Genus** – Closely related species (e.g., *Homo*, *Panthera*).  
8. **Species** – Most specific level (e.g., *Homo sapiens*, *Panthera leo*).  

## Importance
- Provides a **universal language** for scientists.  
- Helps identify and study organisms systematically.  
- Reveals evolutionary relationships and biodiversity.  
- Essential for conservation, medicine, and agriculture.  

## Modern Developments
- **Phylogenetics** – Uses DNA and molecular data to refine classifications.  
- **Cladistics** – Focuses on evolutionary branches and common ancestry.  
- Taxonomy now integrates genetics, ecology, and informatics.
