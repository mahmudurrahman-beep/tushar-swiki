**Nuclear energy** is the energy released during nuclear reactions, primarily fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) and fusion (combining of nuclei). It is used to generate electricity, power ships, and has potential applications in space exploration.

## Origins and Development

- **1938** – Nuclear fission discovered by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.  
- **1940s** – Manhattan Project demonstrated both destructive and peaceful uses of nuclear reactions.  
- **1950s** – First nuclear power plants built for civilian electricity generation.  
- **Present Day** – Nuclear energy provides about 10% of global electricity.  

## How It Works

1. **Nuclear Fission**  
   - Heavy nuclei (e.g., uranium‑235, plutonium‑239) split into smaller nuclei.  
   - Releases large amounts of energy and neutrons.  
   - Used in nuclear reactors.  

2. **Nuclear Fusion**  
   - Light nuclei (e.g., hydrogen isotopes) combine to form heavier nuclei.  
   - Powers the sun and stars.  
   - Still experimental for commercial energy production.  

## Components of a Nuclear Power Plant

- **Reactor Core** – Contains fuel rods with uranium or plutonium.  
- **Control Rods** – Absorb neutrons to regulate the reaction.  
- **Coolant** – Transfers heat from the core.  
- **Steam Generator** – Produces steam to drive turbines.  
- **Turbine and Generator** – Convert mechanical energy into electricity.  

## Advantages

- Produces large amounts of electricity with low greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Reliable base‑load power source.  
- Reduces dependence on fossil fuels.  

## Disadvantages and Risks

- **Radioactive Waste** – Long‑term storage challenges.  
- **Accidents** – Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011) highlight risks.  
- **High Costs** – Construction and decommissioning are expensive.  
- **Nuclear Proliferation** – Technology can be diverted to weapons.  

## Global Use

- Major producers: United States, France, China, Russia, Japan.  
- France generates about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power.  
- Some countries (e.g., Germany) are phasing out nuclear energy.  
- Others (e.g., China, India) are expanding nuclear programs.  

## Future Prospects

- **Fusion Energy** – Projects like ITER aim to make fusion commercially viable.  
- **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** – Safer, more flexible designs.  
- **Advanced Fuel Cycles** – Reduce waste and improve efficiency.
