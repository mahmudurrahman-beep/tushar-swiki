## Definition
**Animals** are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms belonging to the kingdom *Animalia*. They are distinguished by their ability to move voluntarily, consume organic material for energy, and respond rapidly to stimuli.

## Characteristics
- **Multicellular** – Composed of many cells with specialized functions.  
- **Heterotrophic** – Obtain energy by consuming other organisms.  
- **Movement** – Most animals can move at some stage of life.  
- **Nervous System** – Many have complex systems for sensing and responding.  
- **Reproduction** – Primarily sexual, though some reproduce asexually.  

## Classification
Animals are divided into major groups based on body structure and evolutionary history:

1. **Invertebrates** (no backbone)  
   - Examples: insects, mollusks, crustaceans, worms, jellyfish.  
   - Make up ~95% of all animal species.  

2. **Vertebrates** (with backbone)  
   - Examples: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals.  
   - Characterized by a spinal column and internal skeleton.  

## Major Groups of Vertebrates
- **Fish** – Aquatic, gills for breathing.  
- **Amphibians** – Live in water and on land (frogs, salamanders).  
- **Reptiles** – Scaly skin, cold‑blooded (snakes, lizards).  
- **Birds** – Feathers, wings, lay eggs.  
- **Mammals** – Hair/fur, warm‑blooded, produce milk for young.  

## Importance
- **Ecological Roles** – Pollinators, predators, prey, decomposers.  
- **Human Use** – Food, clothing, labor, companionship.  
- **Cultural Significance** – Symbolism in art, religion, and folklore.  

## Fun Facts
- The **blue whale** is the largest animal ever known.  
- The **honeybee** communicates through dances.  
- The **axolotl** can regenerate entire limbs.  
- The **ostrich** is the largest living bird.
