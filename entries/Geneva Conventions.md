The **Geneva Conventions** are a series of international treaties that establish standards of humanitarian treatment during war. They form the core of modern international humanitarian law.

## Background

- Originated in **Geneva, Switzerland**, with the first convention in **1864**.  
- Inspired by the work of **Henry Dunant**, founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  
- Expanded and revised after both World Wars to address new realities of armed conflict.  

## The Four Geneva Conventions (1949)

1. **First Geneva Convention**  
   - Protection of wounded and sick soldiers on land during war.  

2. **Second Geneva Convention**  
   - Protection of wounded, sick, and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea.  

3. **Third Geneva Convention**  
   - Treatment of prisoners of war (POWs).  
   - Prohibits torture, inhumane treatment, and ensures fair trials.  

4. **Fourth Geneva Convention**  
   - Protection of civilians in times of war.  
   - Prohibits deportations, hostage‑taking, and collective punishment.  

## Additional Protocols

- **1977 Protocol I** – Protection of victims in international armed conflicts.  
- **1977 Protocol II** – Protection of victims in non‑international armed conflicts (civil wars).  
- **2005 Protocol III** – Adoption of the Red Crystal as an additional protective emblem.  

## Key Principles

- **Humanity** – Even in war, human dignity must be respected.  
- **Neutrality** – Medical and humanitarian aid must be protected.  
- **Proportionality** – Attacks must not cause excessive civilian harm.  
- **Distinction** – Combatants must distinguish between military targets and civilians.  

## Importance

- Ratified by nearly every country in the world.  
- Provides the legal foundation for humanitarian organizations like the ICRC.  
- Forms the basis of war crimes prosecutions in international courts.  

## Legacy

* The Geneva Conventions remain the cornerstone of international humanitarian law, ensuring that even in armed conflict, basic human rights are protected.*
