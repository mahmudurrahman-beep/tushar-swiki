## Origins
- Emerged during the **Nahda (Arab Renaissance)** in the late 19th century.  
- Reaction to Ottoman decline and European colonialism.  
- Advocated for Arab unity across national borders.  

## Core Principles
- Arabs share a **common language, culture, and history**.  
- Political unity would strengthen independence and resist foreign domination.  
- Often contrasted with **Pan-Islamism**, focusing on Arab identity rather than religion.  

## Historical Development
- **1916 Arab Revolt** against Ottoman rule used the Arab Revolt flag, later a Pan-Arab symbol.  
- After World War I, Arab lands were divided under European mandates, fueling nationalist sentiment.  
- **1950s–1960s:** Pan-Arabism peaked under **Nasser**, promoting unity against colonialism and Israel.  
- Attempts at unity:  
  - **United Arab Republic (1958–1961):** Egypt and Syria merged briefly.  
  - Other federations attempted but failed due to political rivalries.  

## Decline
- Defeat in the **1967 Six-Day War** weakened Pan-Arabist momentum.  
- Rise of **individual nationalisms** (Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi, etc.).  
- Shift toward **Islamism** and local identities in the late 20th century.  

## Legacy
- Influenced Arab flags (Pan-Arab colors: black, white, green, red).  
- Still resonates culturally and politically, though less as a formal movement.  
- Modern debates revisit Pan-Arabism in light of regional conflicts and globalization.
