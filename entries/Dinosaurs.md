## Definition
**Dinosaurs** were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated Earth during the **Mesozoic Era** (about 230 to 66 million years ago). They included both carnivorous and herbivorous species, ranging from small bird‑like creatures to massive giants.

## Timeline
- **Triassic Period (c. 230–201 million years ago)** – First dinosaurs appeared.  
- **Jurassic Period (201–145 million years ago)** – Dinosaurs diversified; iconic species like *Stegosaurus* and *Brachiosaurus*.  
- **Cretaceous Period (145–66 million years ago)** – Peak diversity; species like *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*.  
- **66 million years ago** – Mass extinction event (likely asteroid impact + volcanic activity) wiped out most dinosaurs, except for birds.  

## Characteristics
- Walked upright with legs positioned beneath their bodies.  
- Varied diets: herbivores, carnivores, omnivores.  
- Some had feathers, especially theropods (ancestors of birds).  
- Eggs laid in nests; some species showed parental care.  

## Types
- **Sauropods** – Long‑necked giants (*Diplodocus*, *Brachiosaurus*).  
- **Theropods** – Predatory dinosaurs (*Tyrannosaurus rex*, *Velociraptor*).  
- **Ornithischians** – Herbivores with unique features (*Triceratops*, *Stegosaurus*).  

## Legacy
- Birds are considered living dinosaurs, descended from theropods.  
- Dinosaurs shaped ecosystems for over 160 million years.  
- Fossils provide insights into evolution, climate, and Earth’s history.  

## Fun Facts
- The largest known dinosaur: *Argentinosaurus* (over 30 meters long).  
- The smallest known dinosaur: *Microraptor* (about the size of a crow).  
- Dinosaurs lived on every continent, including Antarctica.
