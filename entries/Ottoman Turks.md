## Definition
The **Ottoman Turks** (*Osmanlı Türkleri*) were a Turkic ethnic group in Anatolia who established and dominated the **Ottoman Empire** (1299–1922). They formed the ruling elite and military backbone of the empire, while also influencing its language, culture, and religion.

## Origins
- Founded by **Osman I** (1258–1326), an Anatolian chieftain.  
- Emerged from the decline of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum.  
- Initially a small principality in northwestern Anatolia.  
- Expanded rapidly into the Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa.  

## Population and Language
- By **1831**: ~7 million Ottoman Turks.  
- By **1884**: ~12.6 million.  
- By **1914**: ~15 million.  
- Languages: **Old Anatolian Turkish** (among common people) and **Ottoman Turkish** (used by elites and in literature).  

## Religion
- Predominantly **Sunni Islam**.  
- Minority groups included Alevis and other Islamic sects.  
- The Sultan also held the title of **Caliph** after 1517, reinforcing religious authority.  

## Role in the Empire
- Formed the **military elite** (e.g., sipahi cavalry).  
- Dominated the **administrative system** and bureaucracy.  
- Spread Turkish culture, blending with Arab, Persian, and Byzantine influences.  
- Maintained the **Ottoman identity** distinct from other ethnic groups in the empire.  

## Legacy
- The Ottoman Turks created one of history’s longest‑lasting empires, spanning over 600 years.  
- Their culture and institutions shaped modern Turkey and influenced Southeast Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.  
- After the empire’s collapse in 1922, the Republic of Turkey emerged, continuing the Turkish identity but reforming language, governance, and society.
