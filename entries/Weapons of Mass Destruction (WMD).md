## Definition
A **Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD)** is any weapon capable of inflicting catastrophic harm on populations, infrastructure, or the environment. Unlike conventional weapons, WMDs are defined by the **scale of their destructive consequences**, not just their method of delivery.

## Types of WMD
1. **Nuclear Weapons**  
   - Use nuclear reactions (fission or fusion).  
   - Examples: Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings (1945).  
   - Effects: Blast, heat, radiation, long‑term contamination.  

2. **Chemical Weapons**  
   - Use toxic chemicals to kill or injure.  
   - Examples: Mustard gas (WWI), sarin gas (Syria).  
   - Effects: Poisoning, burns, environmental damage.  

3. **Biological Weapons**  
   - Spread pathogens or toxins (e.g., anthrax, plague).  
   - Effects: Epidemics, long‑term health crises.  

4. **Radiological Weapons ("Dirty Bombs")**  
   - Disperse radioactive material without a nuclear explosion.  
   - Effects: Contamination, panic, economic disruption.  

## International Control
- **Treaties & Agreements**:  
  - *Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT)* – limits nuclear weapons spread.  
  - *Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)* – bans chemical weapons.  
  - *Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)* – bans biological weapons.  
- **UN Definition (1977)**: Includes atomic, radioactive, chemical, biological, and future weapons with comparable destructive effects.  

## Modern Concerns
- **Proliferation**: Spread of nuclear technology to new states.  
- **Terrorism**: Fear of non‑state actors using chemical or biological agents.  
- **New Classifications**: Recently, the U.S. controversially declared **fentanyl** a WMD due to its massive death toll from overdoses.  

## Importance
- WMDs are central to global security debates.  
- Their use is rare but catastrophic, shaping international law and diplomacy.  
- Efforts continue worldwide to prevent proliferation and promote disarmament.

*WMDs represent humanity’s most destructive technologies, driving both fear and global cooperation to prevent their use.*
